# SDG Text Generation Application

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a text generation application aimed at promoting Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) using an open-source generative AI model. The application generates coherent, creative, and relevant text on SDG topics using the `bloom-560m` model from the Transformers library by Hugging Face.

## Features

- **Text Generation:** Generate text based on user-provided prompts related to SDGs.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple command-line interface for ease of use.
- **High Relevance and Creativity:** The model produces texts that are logically consistent and creatively aligned with SDG topics.
- **Model and Tokenizer:** Utilizes `bloom-560m` for efficient and meaningful text generation.

## Tools and Libraries

- **Transformers Library:** Used to access pre-trained models for NLP tasks.
- **Torch Library:** Handles deep learning operations like tensor computation and optimization.
